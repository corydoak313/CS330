CS330: Computer Graphics and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  As I approach designing software, I read through the requirements of the project and determine what I need to do to complete it. When completing the milestones I took it one step at a time starting with the smaller shapes and then continuing onto the details. Eventually, the smaller shapes grew into bigger ones and I had a better idea of how to complete the project as I chipped a little off at a time. This helped it from becoming too overwhelming as the project got more complex. 
      
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
