CS330: Computer Graphics and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  As I approach designing software, I read through the requirements of the project and determine what I need to do to complete it. When completing the milestones I took it one step at a time starting with the smaller shapes and then continuing onto the details. Eventually, the smaller shapes grew into bigger ones and I had a better idea of how to complete the project as I chipped a little off at a time. This helped it from becoming too overwhelming as the project got more complex. 
      
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

  When developing programs I look at the needs of the program. Who is using it and why? With the end goals of the users in mind, this helps guide the development. Utilizing iteration throughout the program was beneficial as it made sure the different 3D aspects were being applied whenever necessary. Through each Milestone, we gradually added to the project and we were able to make minor adjustments to previously built aspects as we implemented a new feature. I found this to be an effective way to learn how the new skills all tied in together. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  Computer science will help me complete my goals as I will obtain my major degree and one day obtain a job in that career field. Educationally speaking, this course will give me a better insight into how graphics are managed and developed. These skills can be applied when looking into creating more creative projects. Professionally speaking, I do not know how often I will be developing graphics, but I am glad to know more about the concepts!
